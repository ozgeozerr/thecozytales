If you are tired of scrolling and want to spend some quality time by yourself, you've come to the right place! We've gathered some of the best hobbies that you can do inside, while having the best time of your life. 

### 1. Punch Needling

For most people punch needle is unheard of, but when you dig deep into the DIY world, you can find some amazing tutorial for punch needling! All you need is some yarn, the punch needle (very cheap), embroidery hoop and some nettle cloth. The ingredients are easy to find in craft stores and you can create anything you dream of! My favorites to create are Hello Kitty, video game characters and frogs! Once you get the hang of how to use the needle (don't give up!!), it's soo relaxing.

### 2. Air Dry Clay

Air dry clay is the closest thing you can get to being *Michelangelo,* with the comfort of your very own home. Air dry clay is easy to shape, and if you use a little bit of water to fix your happy mistakes, you can get amazing results and have sooo much fun! It is also cheap and very easy to paint after it dries down. You can make little statues, jewerly trays, trinket trays, and almost everything as long as you don't eat out of them (it's not safe). After the paint dries, you can use some glaze to make it shiny and make it come to life! :)

### 3. Making Mini Bricks and Legos

Legos are amazing! But if you want to go extra crazy, you can buy the thousand pieces knock-off versions and put on a podcast, and then spend a good six hours doing so! These 'Bricks' are available eveywhere, and they are really cheap. This Hello Kitty took me almost 6 hours because of the tinyyy bricks.

### 4. Crocheting Plushies

When you first start to learn how to make a magic ring, you feel lost. After watching like 10 videos, you figure it out. After that, just Google your favorite characthers or animals, and you will find some very good tutorials. Again, put on some music and feel the fluffy yarn in your hands... I would recommend Faux Fur Yarn since it is very fun to work with and you can easily cover up your mistakes.

### 5. Painting / Drawing

When it comes to painting, you have to focus on creativity and fun more than you focus on perfection. As long as you have fun with the colors and textures, the end result doesn't matter! Just grab whatever paint and colored pencils you can find, get some inspirations from Pinterest and you're good to go!
