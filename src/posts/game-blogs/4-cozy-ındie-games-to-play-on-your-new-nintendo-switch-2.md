The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally here, and the cozy gaming community couldn’t be more excited! Whether you’re new to the console or just looking to expand your indie game collection, here are four cozy indie games perfect for relaxing evenings and heartfelt adventures.

### Later Alligator

This game is a true hidden gem. From the moment you start the game, you feel like an agent in a big city. I love the atmosphere, the puzzles, characters, music and the art style. There are multiple endings, countless jokes, alligator jazz and a ticking clock! You should check [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/later-alligator-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOor_wxe-txIW6qtSL2iZy7lydwf-iXPGxPtL4np4ZeaBRS9VfzsX)'s website for the pricetag, but generally I think it's worth the price for it's authenticity. This is truly a game you won't get bored of.

### Spiritfarer

Who could guess a game can make your eyes cry out, and make you smile at the same time? Spiritfarer is one of the most emotional games I've ever played. It is impossible to not have an emotional bound with the characters, and when it's time to say goodbye to them before you release them to afterlife, it gets very emotional. You play as Stella, ferrymaster to the deceased, a Spiritfarer. You can farm, mine, fish, harvest, cook, and craft. The map is huge, and it is really fun to explore each part of it. The art style is pleasant as well. Check it out when it's on sale!

### Pixel Cafe

Pixel Cafe is about going through life's challenging events, while working as a barista. Our main characther is working for some shady people, and has to go through many workplaces in her career. It has a very fun gameplay, where you play as a barista behind the counter, sometimes making drinks, sandwiches, cakes, coffee and others. During rush hours, it gets super busy and fun as well. Sometimes you have to put up with electrical issues, also with some hot-headed customers too. The game has good mechanics and gameplay, you have to be quick with your fingers though. It is very fun to play on Switch!

### The Roots of Pacha

Ever wanted to play Stardew Valley but like... in stone age? The Roots of Pacha is right here for you. This game is great for relaxing. No combat, the soundtrack is really peaceful and you can interact with the animals through instruments. You are in a clan, and you can invite your fellow clan members to dance with you at any time. There are festivals, the community feeling is strong. Also, the important part for all of my lovebugs: there are soo many romancable characters! What makes this game interesting is you 'figure out' how to live as you live! For example, you learn to process and preserve food, begin metalworking, create beautiful pottery and art. You can unlock your clan’s spirituality, and invent new buildings to expand your village any way you want.
