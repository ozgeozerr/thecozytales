## The Lore - What Happens in BOTW?

Ever since Princess Zelda's power had weakened after the *Calamity Ganon Incident*, Link had to recover in The Shrine of Ressurection for 100 years. While Link was sleeping like a baby, Divine Beasts began to wonder around Hyrule and became a menace to all folks. After the healing process complete, Link awakened without his memories, and lost everything, but his will to discover with the *Sheikah Slate* left for him there by Zelda. The spirit of [](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/King_Rhoam "King Rhoam")King Rhoam explained to Link what happened in the past century. After countless hours of gameplay and fun, Link finds the undestructable sword, the Master Sword. To weaken Ganon's power and reduce the stress of civilians in Hyrule, Link decides to free the four Divine Beasts. After the Divine Beasts are freed, the spirits of the deceased Champions give Link their powers to save Hyrule. After completing all the quests (higlhly recommended!), Link decides to go to the Hyrule Castle, and fights Calamity Ganon. Zelda, still imprisoned, summons the Bow of Ligth, and Link uses it to weaken Ganon enough to allow Zelda to free herself and seal him away. 

## What Makes BOTW Unique?

The gameplay is the most impressive I've ever played so far! Everywhere you go in the map, it's always something there that sparks your interest. Here is why:

### 1. Do Whatever You Want, Whenever You Want:

You can face the biggest bosses the day you land in Hyrule. You can face some of them. You may not choose to face any of them as well. The non-linearity of the BOTW makes it so unique and interesting. I've watched so many playthrough videos from Youtube and each time, I was suprised with the different ways there was to complete a task or so. Some used extremely powerful weapons and equipments, some used just a torch. 

### 2. It Keeps Your Curiosity Alive

From the first moment of the game, the urge to always explore further is very real. First, you can be anxious and scared, since Link has just woken up, so weak and did not even have any clothing! But then, the beauty of the world reels you in. There is no hand-holding in this game. It forces you to explore and find unique ways to do things. Almost nothing has just one way to do. Every tree, every ruin, every little Korok, every village has a beauty in it that sparks interest. Map is so small in the beginning, and marker free, so you go to places because you want to actually check them, not just because it's marked on the map. After discovering a large percentage of the map, I had to pray to see more and more villages and stables just because I wanted it see more and more!

### 3. The World Is INCREDIBLY Alive

Unlike some games, you can feel NPCs exist before you, and they always have something going on. Even after you complete their side quests, they are busy doing something else, and they variety of dialogues. They have many characteristical traits, there are even some gossipy noisy aunties. Sometimes, they do not realize who Link is, and it is really fun to see how they treat him. My personal favorite is Zora's Domain and Kakariko Village. Both of these 'towns' are visually incredible, full of NPCs and offers Link a great time to spend there. There is always movement, either little kids running around, an old dude just wanders around, or some merchants trying to make a living. You never get bored of checking on them again and again.



### 4. The Weather and Environmental Details

BOTW has a unique mechanic. Every time you have to climb somewhere, it rains. It's a joke, lol. But the long time players will understand this. Link's hands and feet slip a lot when it rains, which forces you to seek an alternative route or just, wait. You actually feel like this is a real world, and as much as your impact the environment, it has an impact on you as well. At some places the weather is electric, and it strikes you, so you need to prepare accordingly. There are hot places, cold places, BURNING places and you can use elixirs or proper armor to spend time in the environment.



## So, is it worth it?

Absolutely yes! I believe this is one of the games that will leave a long lasting impact on you, where it even visits you in your dreams. The music, the design, the atmosphere, the world... Everything leaves you in shock, and you will want to spend your time there forever. Go, and enjoy the Hyrule with Link!
