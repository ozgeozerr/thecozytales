          <p>Yes, we are all busy with work, traffic, social media or countless hours of scrolling. If you want to break the cycle of wasting your life away avoiding your beloved hobbies, this guide is for you to start enjoying things you used to love again. We'll take it slow, so no excuses this time :)</p>
<h2>1. List All Your Interest and all &quot;I wish I could&quot; Hobbies</h2>
<p>First, make a list of things that you find joy in. Plants, animals, cloths, sewing, painting, dough, music... Make an extensive list, so we know what we're working with. If you cannot think of anything, list the things you say 'Ughh I wish I could've done that!'. We will find some intersection about these things a little bit later. After we gather some information about your interest, the next step is the research.</p>

<h2>2. Make Your Research</h2>
<p>Now this is one of the most crucial parts other than enjoying the hobby itself. After you make a brief list of your interests, try to find intersections between them. You like both tech and crocheting? Then check for inspiration on how to connect them. You like reading and cross-stitch? Make a book cover with cross-stitch design. You like baking and painting? Then try to decorate cakes with replicas of some famous paintings. The possibilities are endless!</p>

<h2>3. Get the Supplies</h2>
<p>Okay, I'm gonna admit it. One of the best parts of the hobby is to shop for it! Especially if you like craft stores and stationery stores. After you do your research, list all the base supplies you need, and do not overwhelm yourself with buying everything at once. You don't have to have each color of yarn to start :) If you're not socially anxious ask the staff and they will be more than happy to help you start your desired hobby. I know it's intimidating but it's their job to help you, remember that. Also, please get good quality materials! Whichever hobby you do, it will be so much better for you if your materials are good quality, and it will make the whole process easier.</p>

<h2>4. Start Your First Project and Let Go of Perfectionism</h2>
<p>Now, straight to <a href="https://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> we go. Write down the keywords, create a board, and let it shape itself! You can try keywords like 'easy', 'beginner' and choose one as an inspiration. Pinterest is your best friend to find a starting point, and you can find many great creators there. Download your inspo or save it somewhere. Then, next step: Starting. Yeah, that's right. You do not have to be perfect. You do not need to have all the necessary materials or colors. You do not have to do an amazing job at your first try. You must fail at something first to be succesful in future. Own your progress and focus on having fun instead of having the perfect result. Also, you do not have to monetie your hobby, and you do not have to show it to anyone else if you don't want to. This is your time to enjoy yourself, and you deserve it.</p>

<h2>5. Bonus: Join a Workshop and Meet People with Similar Interests</h2>
<p>It is hard to make brand new friends as an adult, if you only see the people from work. Making friends from stratch, without having any common interest might make things harder too. So, what's better than joining a workshop and bonding over the hobby? You can find many places, coffee shops etc. that over workshops at weekends. It is usually a warm and friendly atmosphere, where there is no judgement. It is really fun to laugh and giggle with strangers about our failures on the projects, which makes it fun. Also this is a great way to see that no one is doing things perfectly. I would advice you to join a pottery / clay workshop as a beginner, you can learn many techniques you cannot learn elsewhere and they can bake it for you.</p>

<h3>So, the conclusion now:</h3>
<p>The more you make time for your hobbies, the better you will feel overall. Hobbies give us some safe and fun mindfullness time, and this is very important for our well-being as an adult. Remember to take care of yourself and enjoy your me time! :))</p>
